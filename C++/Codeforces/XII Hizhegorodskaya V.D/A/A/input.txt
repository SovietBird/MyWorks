This is the living-room of the house
occupied by the eminent Professor
Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife,
Mrs Petunia Evans-Verres, and
their adopted son, Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres. There is a 
letter lying on the living-room
table, and an unstamped envelope of 
yellowish parchment, addressed to 
Mr H Potter in emerald-green ink.

The Professor and his wife are 
speaking sharply at each other, 
but they are not shouting. 
The Professor considers shouting 
to be uncivilised.
